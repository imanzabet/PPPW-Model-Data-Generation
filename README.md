# PPPW-Model-Data-Generation
This project aims to generate synthetic data for input of statistical model of PPPW measure

The code accepts both VAT-SFR (main_vat.py) and KTV (main_ktv) dataset as input and using data transform methods to combine them with UNOS and Patient DOB dataset, in order to transform them into a useful dataset for PPPW model.
